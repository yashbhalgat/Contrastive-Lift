> **TL;DR**: _Our paper presents a novel "slow-fast" contrastive fusion method to lift 2D predictions to 3D for scalable instance segmentation, achieving significant improvements without requiring an upper bound on the number of objects in the scene._

## Data and Pretrained checkpoints
You can download the Messy Rooms dataset from [here](https://figshare.com/s/b195ce8bd8eafe79762b). For all other datasets, refer to
the instructions provided in [Panoptic-Lifting](https://github.com/nihalsid/panoptic-lifting)

**NOTE**: In this codebase, the term "MOS" stands for "Many Object Scenes", which was the original name of the "Messy Rooms" dataset as referenced in the paper.

You can download the **pretrained checkpoints** from [here](https://figshare.com/s/9274111d32b390a870d8).

## Inference and Evaluation
Download the pretrained checkpoints and place them in the `pretrained_checkpoints` folder. Then, run the following commands to evaluate the pretrained models:
```
python3 inference/render_panopli.py --ckpt_path pretrained_checkpoints/<SCENE NAME>/checkpoints/<CKPT NAME>.ckpt --cached_centroids_path pretrained_checkpoints/<SCENE NAME>/checkpoints/all_centroids.pkl
```

This will render the outputs to `runs/<experiment>` folder. To calculate the metrics, run the following command:
```
python inference/evaluate.py --root_path ./data/<SCENE DATA PATH> --exp_path runs/<experiment>
```
